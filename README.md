Tool for remote [EMDR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_movement_desensitization_and_reprocessing) sessions. Sessions under same link are mirrored, and control is shared.

## Requirements
* node 12.14.1 (previous versions might work as well)

## Installation
```
npm install
npm start
```

## Use
* Go to http://localhost:3000/
* You'll be redirected to unique url like http://localhost:3000/o5e577k835e
* Copy that unique link and send it to the person you'd like to work with
* Sessions with the same link are mirrored - you both have full control and same view.
